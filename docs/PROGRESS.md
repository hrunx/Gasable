This will allow products to be linked to specific stores within companies as intended by the store setup wizard. Manual execution required in Supabase dashboard.
- 2025-05-29 16:13 | ðŸ”§ COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE MIGRATION: Created complete store_id fix for all tables - Extended migration to add store_id columns to products, delivery_zones, delivery_vehicles, and delivery_drivers tables.
