# Gasable Supplier Portal Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Gasable Supplier Portal to protect user data, ensure system integrity, and maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Security Architecture

### Multi-layered Security Approach

The Gasable Supplier Portal implements a defense-in-depth strategy with multiple security layers:

1. **Network Security**: Firewalls, DDoS protection, and traffic filtering
2. **Application Security**: Input validation, output encoding, and secure coding practices
3. **Data Security**: Encryption, access controls, and data integrity checks
4. **Authentication & Authorization**: Robust identity verification and permission management
5. **Monitoring & Incident Response**: Real-time monitoring and defined response procedures

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Methods

The platform supports the following authentication methods:

1. **Email and Password**: Standard authentication with strong password requirements
2. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Optional second factor using:
   - Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)
   - SMS verification codes
   - Email verification codes

### Password Policy

- Minimum 10 characters
- Must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character
- Password history enforcement (prevents reuse of last 5 passwords)
- Maximum password age of 90 days
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (unlocked after 30 minutes or by admin)

### Session Management

- JWT-based authentication with short-lived tokens (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens with longer expiration (7 days)
- Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies
- Automatic session termination after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Ability to view and terminate active sessions

### Authorization Model

The platform implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with the following roles:

1. **Admin**: Full system access
2. **Supplier**: Access to own company data and operations
3. **Support**: Limited access to handle customer support
4. **Viewer**: Read-only access to specific data

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

Data in the system is classified into the following categories:

1. **Public**: Information that can be freely disclosed
2. **Internal**: Information for authenticated users only
3. **Confidential**: Sensitive business information
4. **Restricted**: Highly sensitive information (e.g., payment details)

### Encryption

- **Data in Transit**: All communications secured with TLS 1.3
- **Data at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted using AES-256
- **Database Encryption**: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for the database
- **Field-level Encryption**: Additional encryption for highly sensitive fields

### Data Retention and Deletion

- Clear data retention policies based on data classification
- Automated data purging based on retention schedules
- Secure data deletion procedures
- Data anonymization for analytical purposes

## Application Security

### Secure Development Practices

- Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) implementation
- Regular security training for development team
- Code reviews with security focus
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Common Vulnerabilities Protection

1. **Injection Prevention**:
   - Parameterized queries for database operations
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection**:
   - Output encoding
   - Content Security Policy
   - HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**:
   - Anti-CSRF tokens
   - SameSite cookie attribute
   - Origin and Referer header validation

4. **Security Headers**:
   - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   - Permissions-Policy (formerly Feature-Policy)

### API Security

- API key and JWT authentication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Request throttling
- IP-based restrictions for sensitive operations
- Comprehensive logging of API access and operations

## Infrastructure Security

### Cloud Security

- Secure cloud configuration following provider best practices
- Regular security assessments of cloud resources
- Least privilege principle for service accounts
- Network segmentation and security groups

### Database Security

- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- Database connection encryption
- Regular security patching
- Automated backups with encryption

### Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized logging system
- Real-time security monitoring
- Automated alerts for suspicious activities
- Log retention for compliance and forensics
- Regular log reviews

- Continuous automated security scanning
- Third-party security audits

### Bug Bounty Program

- Responsible disclosure policy
- Rewards for security researchers
- Clear scope and guidelines
- Timely response to reported vulnerabilities

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Response Plan

1. **Preparation**: Documented procedures, trained team, and necessary tools
2. **Detection & Analysis**: Monitoring systems and analysis procedures
3. **Containment**: Immediate actions to limit damage
4. **Eradication**: Removing the threat from systems
5. **Recovery**: Restoring systems to normal operation
6. **Post-Incident Activities**: Learning and improving from incidents

### Breach Notification
