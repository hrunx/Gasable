# Gasable Supplier Portal Deployment Guide

## Overview

This document provides detailed instructions for deploying the Gasable Supplier Portal to production environments. It covers environment setup, build process, deployment procedures, and post-deployment verification.

## Deployment Architecture

The Gasable Supplier Portal uses a modern deployment architecture:

- **Frontend**: React application deployed to Netlify
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage)
- **CDN**: Content delivery network for static assets
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring and error tracking

## Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure you have:

1. **Netlify Account**: For hosting the frontend application
2. **Supabase Project**: For backend services
3. **Domain Name**: For production environment
4. **SSL Certificate**: For secure HTTPS connections
5. **Environment Variables**: Configuration for different environments

## Environment Setup

### Supabase Configuration

1. **Create Supabase Project**:
   - Sign in to [Supabase](https://app.supabase.io/)
   - Create a new project
   - Note the project URL and API keys

2. **Database Setup**:
   - Run the migration scripts in the `supabase/migrations` directory
   - Verify the database schema is correctly created
   - Set up initial data if required

3. **Authentication Setup**:
   - Configure email authentication
   - Set up password policies
   - Configure email templates

4. **Storage Setup**:
   - Create buckets for product images, documents, etc.
   - Configure access policies

### Environment Variables

Create environment variables for different deployment environments:

#### Development

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-dev-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-dev-anon-key
VITE_API_URL=https://api-dev.gasable.com/v1
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

#### Staging

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-staging-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-staging-anon-key
VITE_API_URL=https://api-staging.gasable.com/v1
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=staging
```

#### Production

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-prod-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-prod-anon-key
VITE_API_URL=https://api.gasable.com/v1
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## Build Process

### Frontend Build

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Preview Build Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

### Build Optimization

1. **Code Splitting**: Ensure code splitting is configured for optimal loading
2. **Asset Optimization**: Compress images and other assets
3. **Bundle Analysis**: Review bundle size and optimize large dependencies
4. **Tree Shaking**: Verify unused code is removed from the bundle

## Deployment Procedures

### Netlify Deployment

1. **Connect Repository**:
   - Sign in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your repository

2. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
